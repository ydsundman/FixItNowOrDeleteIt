## The Definitive Bug Management System!

Welcome to Fix It Now or Delete It!

Do you have a mountain of bugs? Are you tired of sitting in endless meetings to go through them, only to have to do it all over again at the next meeting? Would you prefer to focus on creating the best product possible instead? Well, using this system you can stop managing bugs and start focusing on quality.

### The system
Are you ready to prioritize and fix the bug? If so, then fix it now.
If not, then delete it.

It's that simple. When it comes to bugs, you only have two options: Fix it now or delete it.
